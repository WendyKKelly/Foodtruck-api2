# Foodtruck-api2
Creating two repos for practice. One for simply practicing methods on github/using git and two for the course on using DigitalOcean.

This repo created to help me follow along with "Create a REST API with Node.js" on Site Point. Created the foodtruck api as part of previous course, then needed to access the files for the course on deploying to Digital Ocean.
